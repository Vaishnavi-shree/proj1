    <h2>🐴 The Trojan Horse: A Myth with a Cyber Lesson</h2>
    <p>
      Hundreds of years ago, the Greeks were trying to capture the city of Troy but failed after a long war. So they came up with a clever plan. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greeks built a giant wooden horse and hid some of their best soldiers inside it. They left the horse outside the city gates and acted like they had given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Trojans thought it was a gift of peace and brought the horse inside their city walls. But at night, while everyone was asleep, Greek soldiers came out of the horse and opened the gates for their army. Troy was defeated from the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      💡 Just like that, in the digital world, a <strong>Trojan Horse</strong> is a dangerous file or app that looks safe and useful — like a free game, software, or email attachment — but actually contains malware that can harm your computer or steal your data.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #e74c3c;">
      👉 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Never trust unknown files, links, or software. Even if something looks helpful, it might be hiding a threat inside — just like the Trojan Horse!
